# Reddit Reader

This is a simple client for reading Reddit from a Steam Deck or basically anything that can 
be compiled from Godot

Currently the list of subreddits is static and all that is displayed is the title and body of the 
posts in a particular subreddit. 

On the steamdeck
A and B button go betweem subreddits. 
DPAD-L or A go to prev article
DPAD-R or D go to next article
DPAD-U or W go down half screen
DPAD-D or S go up half screen
